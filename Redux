*Install redux 

    npm install react-redux --save

* State is updated through actions that are dispatched

    store.dispatch({
        type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',
        filter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'
    }) 


* to tie state and actions together, we write a function called a reducer: a function that takes state and action as arguments, and returns the next state of the app

    function visibilityFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {
        if (action.type === 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER') {
            return action.filter
        } else {
            return state
        }
    }
